# Drasa AI 🤖

Drasa AI is a frontend chat AI project built to learn by building, not just reading docs.

This project focuses on creating a clean, Gemini-style chat interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with real AI responses powered by the Gemini API.

## ✨ Features

- Clean and modern chat UI  
- User and AI message rendering  
- Chat history with local storage  
- Sidebar for previous chats  
- Theme toggle (light/dark)  
- Clear chat option  
- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile  
- API-based AI responses via Gemini API  

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript  
- Gemini API  
## ⚠️ API Quota & Rate Limits

Drasa AI uses the Gemini API, which has strict rate limits and quotas (e.g., 20 requests per minute for the free tier of gemini-2.5-flash). If you see errors like "quota exceeded" or "rate limit reached," you must wait before sending more requests.

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Streaming responses  
- Model switching UI  
- Better animations and transitions  
- Auth UI (frontend only)  
- Performance optimizations  

## 📌 Status

Actively improving and experimenting.  
This project is part of a daily learning and building journey.
