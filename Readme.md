# Drasa AI 🤖

Drasa AI is a frontend chat AI project built to learn by building, not just reading docs.

This project focuses on creating a clean, Gemini-style chat interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with real AI responses powered by the Gemini API.

## ✨ Features

- Clean and modern chat UI  
- User and AI message rendering  
- Chat history with local storage  
- Sidebar for previous chats  
- Theme toggle (light/dark)  
- Clear chat option  
- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile  
- API-based AI responses via Gemini API  

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript  
- Gemini API  
## ⚠️ API Quota & Rate Limits

Drasa AI uses the Gemini API, which has strict rate limits and quotas (e.g., 20 requests per minute for the free tier of gemini-2.5-flash). If you see errors like "quota exceeded" or "rate limit reached," you must wait before sending more requests, or upgrade your API plan. See:

- [Gemini API Rate Limits](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/rate-limits)
- [Monitor Usage](https://ai.dev/rate-limit)

If you encounter persistent errors, check your API key, plan, and usage dashboard.

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of Drasa AI is to strengthen frontend fundamentals before moving to frameworks like React and backend development.  
Every feature is built step by step to understand how real chat applications work.

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Streaming responses  
- Model switching UI  
- Better animations and transitions  
- Auth UI (frontend only)  
- Performance optimizations  

## 📌 Status

Actively improving and experimenting.  
This project is part of a daily learning and building journey.
